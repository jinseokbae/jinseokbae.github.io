Welcome to my website! I'm a 2nd-year Ph.D. student at Seoul National University, fortunate to be under the guidance of Professor [Young Min Kim](https://3d.snu.ac.kr/members/). 
My primary research focus revolves around the captivating realms of **Computer Animation and Robotics**. Additionally, I find myself deeply intrigued by the potential of state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms. I really enjoy debating or exploring challenging problems.

Curiosity serves as the strongest motivation behind my research journey. There's an unparalleled sense of joy that accompanies the thought of envisioning and unraveling new ideas yet to be discovered. I firmly believe that this insatiable curiosity propels me forward in my pursuit of knowledge and innovation.
