I'm a 2nd-year Ph.D. student at Seoul National University, advised by Professor [Young Min Kim](https://3d.snu.ac.kr/members/). 
My research focuses on Computer Animation and Robotics, especially about motion synthesis.
I'm also investigating methods to improve quality of motion captures and digital avatars using various kinds of vision data.
